    Here are a few examples of how you need to act:

    Output: ðŸ“°

    Input: Unlocking the Mysteries of Face Pareidolia: Exploring the Evolution of Facial Recognition.
    Output: ðŸ¤–

    Okay, now the title will be between 3 < and > symbols. 
                
    Input: <<<{text}>>>.
    Output: `;
